	<p>Ok, you've made your first "Hello World" app and covered the <a href="../what-is-ruby-on-rails" target="_blank">basis of RoR</a>, now comes the question: what can <b>RoR</b> do for me other that having a sweet-ass syntax and a mind-blowing framework?</p>
	<p>Quick answer: <b>Gems</b>, a renowned and ever growing community at <b><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a></b> and the assurance that the guys behind <b>RoR</b>'s code take security and performance issues, very serious.</p>
	<p>Almost every web app have something in common with one another and this is where <b>Gems</b> come into play, its boring and demotivating to repeat or re-do code for a certain functionality that someone-else might probably have done it better and more efficiently then you.</p>
	<p>So here's a list of some basic needs that you'll probably have and can easily solve by just installing a <b>Gem</b> and readying its configuration/usage documentation:</p>
	<ul>
