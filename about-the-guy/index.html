	<p>I was born and raised in Albufeira (Portugal) a tourist magnet with fantastic beaches, good weather all-year-round and one of Portugal's cities with be best quality of life.</p>
	<p>Started learning Piano when I was 8 and drop it at 15 some time after I got my first computer and started learning Visual Basic; got addicted and that led me to choose the Computer Science Course in HighSchool, where I learned Pascal, C, and again VB, among other wild and crazy things like “Microsoft Office”.</p>
	<p>Life was good, lots of fun, met my girlfriend (now wife) but at the age of 18 I wanted something more and moved to the “big city”, Lisbon (Portugal’s Capital).</p>
	<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<div class="top_bar bottom_bar">
	<img class="floated_right" alt="IST-TAGUS" src="ist.jpg" style="width:250px;margin-top:20px;"><h3>University</h3>
	<p>I applied for what it is now called Degree (BSc) in Communication Networks Engineering, at <a href="http://www.ist.utl.pt/" target="_blank">Instituto Superior Técnico</a> and got out, years latter, with the Master Degree (MSc) in Communication Networks Engineering.</p>
	<p>Wrote my Master’s thesis on a solution to add Role Authentication capabilities to the Portuguese e-ID card “Cartão do Cidadão” (CC). This thesis served has a pilot project by the “Agência para a Modernização Administrativa” (AMA), to launch a tender process for the second phase of the CC and this consequently made one of the racing companies (GFI Portugal) to invite me to work for them.</p>
	<p>During this University period I also started practicing Karate Shito-Ryu and latter on, Parkour.</p>
	<p>Got the pleasure to be and work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Belle" target="_blank">David Belle</a> and his brother Jeff on a show organized by my parkour team: Parkour Portugal; also had some theater experience with <a href="http://www.clara-andermatt.com/" target="_blank">Clara Andermatt</a>, on a street play that included parkour; it was an interesting experience for me, no doubt.</p>
	<p>Took a Japanese level 1 curse at the Japanese embassy, it was only level 1 but it gave a little perception of the Japanese culture, which I intend to visit some day.</p>
	<p>Me and my friends, formed the first Parkour Association in Portugal, in order to help make it known and less marginalized by the general public and give support to people that practice it.</p>
</div>

<div class="top_bar bottom_bar">
	<h3>Adulthood</h3>
	<p>After my Master Thesis, I had some money that allowed me to dedicate myself full-time to a personal project that a friend of mine started. I didn’t know at the time, but this was my first startup experience, we worked 12 to 14 hours a day, to deliver a product that was gaining traction until it gain enough attention to make Apple’s lawyers send us an intimidation saying that we either drop our trademark registration process our "prepare meet your doom" and since we didn't like "doom" that much, we drop the case; eventually the money ran out and I had to take the job offer that GFI made.</p>
	<p>I’ve enrolled on a music School to learn Bass guitar, haven’t practice Piano much, since I’ve fallen in love with the bass. Got myself a band and all that. Thinking about going to Amsterdam to take a real Bass Guitar curse.</p>
	<p>Had to stop doing parkour due to some nasty injuries, bought a downhill bike to regain some of that adrenaline rush, soon after, got a dirt-bike to evolve certain technics.</p>
	<p>Gonna start learning Kung Fu, when I finally recover from my knees injury.</p>

				<h4><a href="http://parkour.pt/" target="_blank">Parkour Portugal</a></h4>
				<p>Started of has a small site and eventually grew up to be the Portuguese representation of David Belle’s parkour.</p>
				<p>We’ve organized free jams from North to South, East to West, workshops at schools, payed events, given interviews to the press and even opened up parkour schools, all with the purpose of raising parkour awareness, teach others of how to practice it and to educate the population of what parkour is all about.</p>
				<p>We’ve been in close contact with David Belle’s organization and where recognize has its representatives in Portugal, even made a major event that gather all of Portugal’s traceurs and David Belle in a massive structure built just for this event.</p>
				<p>My work consisted in co-organizing parkour events, designing flyers, posters, banners and all kind of brand awareness material, some video editing, system administrator, building and managing a custom CMS to house all our data: photos, videos, articles, tutorials, scanned press interviews, news, etc.</p>
				<p>We’ve also create the first Portuguese Parkour Association, but sadly, we all have to start working some time in our lives and the project eventually died.</p>
				<p>Best years of my live.</p>

				<h4><a href="http://ama.pt/" target="_blank">AMA</a></h4>
				<p>AMA is an agency responsible for simplifying the bridge between a government and its citizens; in other words its responsible for implementing what it is now called “e-Government” in Portugal.</p>
				<p>Portugal has implemented some impressive e-ID technology and my thesis tries “evolve” that technology by solving the problem of: How to certify a citizen’s role or attribute, on the “digital world”; for example: An attorney is signing a sensitive digital file, with its e-ID certificate. How can he prove that the person holder of that certificate is actually a real attorney recognized by the “Order of Attorneys”?</p>
				<p>I needed AMA documentation and technology and AMA was looking for a solution for this problem, so, naturally I ended up working for them, until my thesis was complete.</p>

				<h4><a href="http://gfi.pt/" target="_blank">GFI Portugal</a></h4>
				<p>Due to the CC’s second phase tender process, I got a job offer at GFI that was applying for that contest. I did what I was supposed to, everyone was nice to me and made sure the new-guy felted “at home” but the “suit &amp; tie” life style that big companies naturally have to have and the sheer number of employees, made me feel unfulfilled and unaccounted for.</p>
				<p>So against my friends and family advice to stick up with a steady job in (what it was then) a time of crises, I quit my job and searched for a small company that did what I like to do the most, WebDevelopment.</p>

				<h4><a href="http://www.rupeal.com/" target="_blank">Rupeal</a></h4>
				<p>Rupeal has small but great IT unit that has developed some sweet Web Apps in Ruby on Rails (RoR) and has the open policy to let its members express their talent and participate in the decision making process.</p>
				<p>I always wanted to learn RoR but never had the time, still, decided to applied for this “wonder” team’s open job and not also I got in, but got solo assigned to lead a new project, supervised by a senior developer.</p>
				<p>This project took around 6 months to release and required me to do WebDesign, Front-end and Back-end development and weekly SCRUM meetings with the Client.</p>

			<td class="work_content">
				<h4><a href="http://outitude.com/" target="_blank">Outitude</a></h4>
				<p>While I was working at Rupeal, some of its team members decided to launch their own startup and to tell the truth I was happy to work at Rupeal but working on a genuine startup since its birth and being part of that adventure, was a dream that I though I could only get by leaving my country. So after I finish my project at Rupeal and joined Outitude.</p>
				<p>Our driven factor is quite simple: "We enable outdoor adventures to our communities".</p>
				<p>Through a marketplace with real live reservation availabilities, configured by the actual provider, we offer to our users the capability to find new outdoor activities, compare prices and review them.</p>
				<p>Take a look at: <a href="http://outitude.com/" target="_blank">outitude.com</a></p>
				<p>Now I can honestly say, that I do what I love and get paid to do it.</p>
